## About

_**DISCLAIMER: This code is provided as-is and has not been audited for security or functionality. Use at your own risk.**_

This GitHub repository contains the smart contract code and comprehensive test suite for a Reflection Token built on the ERC20 standard. The contract automatically redistributes transaction fees to token holders, enabling passive revenue sharing based on transaction volume. Adapted from the [RFI](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1afffe3f4d611d252010e3eaf6f4d77088b0cd7#code) smart contract, it removes liquidity and marketing fees, incorporates OpenZeppelin contracts, and uses a newer Solidity version for enhanced security and best practices. A detailed explanation of the reflection mechanism is available [here](https://github.com/regohiro/reflect-contract-doc/blob/main/), with a PDF version in the [docs](https://github.com/trashpirate/reflection-token/tree/master/docs) folder.

The repository includes an error analysis addressing a discrepancy between the total token supply and the sum of individual balances, identified during testing (see `ReflectionTokenInvariantTest::invariant__TokenSupply`). This issue likely stems from rounding errors during conversions between R and T spaces. Analysis suggests the error grows with the number of accounts receiving reflections but diminishes with increased transaction volume. While data is limited, the rounding error appears to remain small, with low impact on contract functionality, though it exhibits increased volatility and randomness with more transfers.


## Installation

### Install dependencies
```bash
$ make install
```

## Usage
Before running any commands, create a .env file and add the following environment variables:

```bash
# network configs
RPC_LOCALHOST="http://127.0.0.1:8545"

# ethereum nework
RPC_TEST=<rpc url>
RPC_MAIN=<rpc url>
ETHERSCAN_KEY=<api key>

# accounts to deploy/interact with contracts
ACCOUNT_NAME="account name"
ACCOUNT_ADDRESS="account address"
```

Update chain ids in the `HelperConfig.s.sol` file for the chain you want to configure:

- Ethereum: 1 | Sepolia: 11155111
